The "pre" folder is for gaining DFT training data, including wave functions, superbands, and charge density. The VAE_training folder contains the 3D VAE structure and codes to train VAE parameters.

In order to run the code, first enter "pre" folder and run "control.py"

python control.py

Then copy the figures folder generated by control.py to the "VAE_training" folder.

In the VAE training folder, run autoencoder_multiple_train.py, autoencoder_super_train.py, Vartional_autoencoder_multiple_rot_sota.py, which are respectively the VAE training code for charge density, superbands and wave functions.

Then run NN_multiple_GW.py, which uses latent space generated by the above VAEs to predict the final GW energy.
